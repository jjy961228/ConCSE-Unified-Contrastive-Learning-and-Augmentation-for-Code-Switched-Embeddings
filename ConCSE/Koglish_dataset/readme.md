Our proposed Koglish_dataset consists of Koglish_GLUE,Koglish_NLI,Koglish_STS.
Due to capacity issues, we uploaded 500 example data sets of each task within each dataset.
For example, in the cola task of the Koglish_GLUE dataset, "cross_train" contains our proposed English-Korean Code-Switched data and the original English dataset. Also, "parsed_train" contains only the original English dataset.

The Koglish dataset Koglish_GLUE is used for the Koglish dataset validation experiment in section 5.1, and the Koglish datasets Koglish_NLI and Koglish_STS are used for our proposed ConCSE experiment in section 5.2.
